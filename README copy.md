Movement rules:
- Vowels (a, e, i, o, u, y) tilts the beam to the left
- Consonants (the rest of the english alphabet) tilts the beam to the right
- If you press both a consonant and a vowel, the ball will stay still
- If you press to vowels and only one consonant, the beam will tilt to the left
- Spacebar - Can be used as a brake and will cut the speed with 20%
- The ball is affected by
  - Gravity
  - Friction
  - Tilt of the beam

Obstacles:
- Beam edges: If the ball goes beyond the edges of the beam, the ball will fall of and the game starts over
- Danger zone: If the ball are too far from the middle of the beam it will get to the "danger zone" where the ball turns red as a warning

Winning:
- When the ball is inside "the balance zone" for three seconds 
- The final score display appears and the user finds out their time (how long it took before they balanced it)
